# weather_ruby
Small Ruby script to query OPenWeatherMap for LA weather and random US city weather
To use:
Make sure Ruby is installed on your Linux-based system.  If you are using an Apple Macintosh computer you may use the 'Spotlight Search" utility to open the built-in 'Terminal' application.  To do this, find the icon of the magnifying glass in the upper-right corner of your screen.  Click and type "Terminal" in the Spotlight Search bar, then hit the Return key.  This should open the Terminal Application on your computer.

Once Terminal is open, type "which ruby" to see if Ruby is installed on your computer.  If Ruby is not installed you can follow the instructions in this link to install Ruby on your computer.

If the Ruby executible is already installed, you can continue by cloning this repo to your computer.
````
# bash$ git clone https://github.com/ekeegan/weather_ruby.git
````

After the repo is cloned, cd into the weather_ruby directory to find the weather.rb script.  To run the script, simply type the name of the ruby executable followed by a single space, followed by the name of the weather script:
````
# ruby weather.rb
````

That's it.
